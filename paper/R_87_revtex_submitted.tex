\begin{abstract}
\noindent
We present a measurement of the ratio of the top-quark 
branching fractions 
$R=\mathcal{B}(t\rightarrow  Wb)/\mathcal{B}(t\rightarrow Wq)$, where $q$ represents quarks of type
 $b$, $s$, or  $d$, 
in the final state with a lepton and hadronic jets. 
The measurement uses $\sqrt{s}$ = 1.96 TeV proton--antiproton collision data from 8.7 fb$^{-1}$ 
of integrated luminosity
collected with the Collider Detector at Fermilab during Run II of the Tevatron. 
We simultaneously measure $R=0.94 \pm 0.09$ (stat+syst), the $t\bar{t}$ production cross section 
$\sigma_{t \bar t} = 7.5 \pm 1.0$ (stat+syst) pb. 
The magnitude of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa  matrix element, 
$\left|V_{tb}\right| = 0.97 \pm 0.05$ (stat+syst) is extracted 
assuming three generations of quarks,
and a lower limit of $|V_{tb}|>0.89$ at 95\% credibility level is set.

In the standard model (SM) the top--quark decay rate into a $W$
boson and a down-type quark $q$ ($q = d, s, b$) is proportional to 
$\left|V_{tq}\right|^{2}$, the squared magnitude of the element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) 
matrix~\cite{CKM}. Under the assumption of a 3 $\times$ 3 unitary 
CKM matrix and using the existing constraints on $V_{ts}$ and $V_{td}$, the magnitude of the top--bottom quark coupling is
$\left |V_{tb}\right|=0.99915^{+0.00002}_{-0.00005}$ \cite{PDG, Vts}, and  the  
top quark decays almost exclusively to $Wb$ final states. 
Any significant deviation from the expected value would imply new physics: an extra generation of quarks, 
non-SM top-quark production, or non-SM background to top-quark production.
A direct measurement of the magnitude of the $V_{tb}$ matrix element can be 
obtained from    the single-top-quark production cross-section~\cite{singletop},
which is proportional to $\left|V_{tb}\right|^{2}$. The value of
$\left|V_{tb}\right|$ can also be extracted from the decay rate of pair-produced top quarks.
%from the top--quark decay rate in the $t \bar t$ production channel. 
We define  $R$ as 
the ratio of the branching fractions
\begin{equation} 
R =\frac{\mathcal{B}(t\rightarrow Wb)}{\mathcal{B}(t\rightarrow Wq)}.
\label{eq:Rratio}
\end{equation}
Given the unitarity of the CKM matrix and assuming three generations,
$R$ is indirectly determined by the knowledge of 
$V_{ts}$ and $V_{td}$,
\begin{equation}
R = \frac{\left|V_{tb}\right|^2}{\left|V_{tb}\right|^2+\left|V_{ts}\right|^2+\left|V_{td}\right|^2}, 
\label{eq:Rratio2}
\end{equation}
and is derived to be $0.99830^{+0.00004}_{-0.00009}$~\cite{PDG}. A deviation from this prediction would be an 
indication of non-SM physics.

This Letter reports the first CDF simultaneous measurement of $R$ and 
top-quark-pair-production cross section
$\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$                                                       
%obtained using the full Run II data set.     a measurement of $R$ 
performed on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 8.7 fb$^{-1}$
 collected with the CDF II detector ~\cite{CDFII} at the Fermilab Tevatron $p\bar{p}$ Collider 
at center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV. 
The analysis  uses events with a lepton and multiple jets in the final state,
where one $W$ boson coming from 
$t\bar t$ production  decays into a quark and an antiquark while the 
second $W$ boson decays into a charged lepton (electron or muon) and a neutrino. 

CDF has performed several
measurements of $R$ during both Run I and Run II, combining the lepton+jets
final state  with the dilepton final state, where both $W$ bosons decay into leptons. The most recent 
publication reported
$R=1.12^{+0.21}_{-0.19}$(stat) $^{+0.17}_{-0.13}$(syst), and $R>0.61$ at 95\% confidence level (C.L.) using
162 pb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity~\cite{R2005}.  The D0
Collaboration  measured  $R=0.90\pm0.04$ (stat+syst) and
$R>0.79$ at 95\% C.L.~\cite{d0meas} using data from 5.4 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, 
%with a simultaneous fit to $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$ 
in the lepton+jets and dilepton final states combined.  
%The CMS Collaboration presented the first preliminary  measurement from the LHC, 
%$R = 0.98 \pm 0.04$(stat+syst)~\cite{CMS}. 
%In this Letter we present the first CDF simultaneous measurement of $R$ and $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$ 
%obtained using the full Run II data set.

The CDF II detector~\cite{CDFII} consists of a charged-particle
tracking system in a magnetic field of 1.4 T, segmented electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters with a  pointing geometry, 
and muon detectors. A silicon microstrip detector provides determination of charged-particle trajectories 
(tracking) over the radial range 1.5 to 28 cm, and is essential
for the detection of displaced decay (secondary) vertices. 
A three-level, online event-selection system (trigger)~\cite{trigger} is used to select events with an 
electron (muon)  candidate in the central detector region
(pseudorapidity $| \eta | < 1.1 $)~\cite{coord}, 
with  $E_T$ ($p_{T}$) $>$ 18 GeV (18 GeV/$c$), 
which form the data set for this analysis. 

The measurement of $R$ is based on the determination of the number of $b$-quark jets in
$t \bar t$ events reconstructed in  the lepton+jets final state. 
The lepton+jets signature consists of a high-$p_{T}$ charged electron ($e$) or muon  ($\mu$),
large missing transverse energy $\slashed E_T$~\cite{coord} due to the undetected neutrino from the leptonic $W$ decay,
and at least three hadronic jets. Events containing  muons are classified according to the coverage of the
detectors used for their identification as central, when $| \eta | < 0.6$, and forward, when $0.6 < | \eta | < 1.0$.
%a muon are classified (according to the various detectors in which 
%muons are identified) in events with muons with $| \eta | < 0.6$ and events with muons with $0.6 < | \eta | < 1.0$. 
Identification of jets coming from $b$-quark
fragmentation
 ($b$-jet tagging)
is performed by the {\sc{secvtx}}
%SECVTX
algorithm, which is based on the reconstruction of secondary vertices displaced from the
primary $p\bar{p}$ interaction vertex and selects a sample enriched  with jets
originating from $b$ quarks~\cite{cuts}. 
The lepton+jets selection requirements are described  in Ref.~\cite{cuts}.
Briefly, the analysis requires the presence of one isolated lepton ($e$ or $\mu$)
with $E_T$ greater than 20 GeV,  $\slashed E_{T}$ of at least 20 GeV, and
 a minimum of three jets, reconstructed using
a cone algorithm~\cite{JES} with radius $\Delta R = 0.4 $ in $\eta - \phi$ space~\cite{coord},
within $\left|\eta\right|< 2.0$. The jet $E_{T}$, after correcting for the calorimeter response~\cite{JES},
has to exceed 30, 25, and 20 GeV for the most-energetic, second-most-energetic, and any additional jet
in the event, respectively.
The $W$-boson transverse mass~\cite{coord} is required to be greater than
20 GeV/$c^{2}$. Events with one  or two  identified $b$-jets are selected (1 $b$-tag and 2 $b$-tag events, respectively).

The background processes include $W$-boson production in association with heavy-flavor jets 
($Wb\bar{b}$, $Wc\bar{c}$, $Wc$), $W$-boson production in association 
with light-flavor jets that are incorrectly identified as $b$-jets (``mistags''), quantum chromodynamics 
 multijet (``QCD'') events containing misreconstructed or
real leptons or incorrectly-measured $\slashed E_T$, diboson events ($WW$, $WZ$, $ZZ$),  
single-top-quark production, and $Z$+jets events.

We divide the selected sample into subsets according to the type of lepton, number
of jets in the final state, and number of identified  $b$ jets (one or two).
As explained in more detail below, we derive an expected event yield for each category. We then maximize the
likelihood for observing the events found in each category 
by varying two fit parameters, $R$ and the top-quark-pair-production
cross section $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$.
%~\cite{PFtesi}.


The $t\bar{t}$  events are modeled using the {\sc pythia}~\cite{pythia}  Monte Carlo (MC)
generator with top-quark mass $m_t$ = 172.5 GeV/$c^2$. 
We estimate the backgrounds
with a collection of data-driven and simulation techniques described in detail in Ref.~\cite{cuts}. 
The QCD background is modeled using data control samples~\cite{QCDback}. 
Mistags are estimated using a matrix (the mistag matrix) calculated in control samples and parametrized 
as a function of jet and event characteristics~\cite{QCDback}.
Diboson processes 
are simulated using {\sc pythia}; single-top-quark production is simulated by 
 {\sc powheg}~\cite{powheg}, while the parton shower and fragmentation is provided by {\sc pythia}.
The  {\sc alpgen}~\cite{alpgen} generator, with {\sc pythia} 
supplying the parton shower and fragmentation, is used to model the
$W$+jets and $Z$+jets backgrounds.
A {\sc geant}-based simulation is used to model the response of the CDF II
detector~\cite{geant}. The cross sections used for background normalization can be found 
in Ref.~\cite{QCDback}.
Table \ref{table:m2calc} shows the expected sample composition for all final states, after summing over lepton categories,
 assuming  $R=1$ and $\sigma_{t\bar{t}} =7.04\pm 0.49$ pb~\cite{topxsec}.

The number of $b$-tagged events is the most sensitive quantity to possible values of $R$ different from one:
%The most important effect of $R \neq 1$ is on the number of
%$b$-tagged events: 
the smaller  $R$, the smaller  the probability to have a
$b$-jet in a top-quark-pair event.
Hence, the fraction of events with one or two tags is expected to decrease with
decreasing $R$.
In general, the $t\bar{t}$ production cross-section measured by CDF in the lepton+jets sample assumes $R$=1. 
In order to avoid any bias due to
this premise, we measure simultaneously $R$ and the production cross-section, since the measurement of the latter is 
affected by the sum of events in the different tag bins.

To perform the fit, we first divide the sample into 18 independent  subsamples, organized by type of lepton,
%(CEM, CMUP or CMX), 
 number of jets in the event (3, 4, $\ge$ 5), and 
number of identified $b$-jets.
The expected number of  events in each  subsample, $\mu_{exp}^{i,j}$, 
is given by the following expression:
\begin{equation}
\mu_{exp}^{i,j} = \mu_{t\bar t}^{i,j} +N_B^{i,j} = \mathscr{L}^{j} \epsilon_{evt}^{i,j}  \sigma_{t\bar t} 
\epsilon_{tag}^i (R) + N_B^{i,j},
\label{eq:equationttexpected}
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{t\bar t}^{i,j}$ is the expected number of $t\bar t$ events and $N_B^{i,j}$ the expected 
number of background events. The  $i$ and $j$ indices indicate the $i$th jet bin  with one or two identified $b$-jets
(jet-tag category)  and the $j$th lepton category, respectively.  
$\mathscr{L}^{j}$ is the integrated luminosity, 
$\epsilon_{evt}^{i,j}$ includes the trigger and lepton identification efficiencies, and $\epsilon^{i}_{tag}(R)$ is 
the event-tagging efficiency, {\it i.e.}, the efficiency for tagging at least one jet in an event.
In an ideal case without background and assuming a $b$-tagging efficiency equal one for jets originating from $b$ quarks
and zero for
jets originating from non-$b$ quarks, the number of expected events with two  tags is proportional to $R^2$,
while the number of expected events
with one  tag is proportional to $2R(1-R)$.
The estimates for the background processes are calculated with various values of $R$. The differences with 
respect to the estimates obtained with $R=1$ are found to be negligible.

%In an ideal case without background and assuming a $b$-tagging efficiency equal one for jets originating from $b$ quarks 
%and zero for 
%jets originating from non-$b$ quarks, the number of expected events with two  tags is proportional to $R^2$, 
%while the number of expected events
%with one  tag is proportional to $2R(1-R)$. 

The event-tagging efficiencies 
are calculated in $t\bar{t}$ MC samples, using the probability to tag a jet as a $b$-jet according to the 
{\sc{secvtx}}
% SECVTX 
algorithm, on a jet-by-jet basis. For jets originated from $b$ and $c$ quarks, the $b$-jet 
tagging efficiencies are corrected for differences between data and MC using a scale factor 
SF = $0.96 \pm 0.05$~\cite{SF}. For jets originated from light-flavor quarks, the probability to tag them as 
$b$-jets is obtained using the mistag matrix.

In general, $\epsilon_{tag}^{i}$ is calculated from the  event probability %$P_i^m$ 
to tag the $m$th event in MC processes with
possible $b$-quark final states. For an event with $n$ generic jets, the probability to have one 
(Eq. (\ref{eq:quattro})) or two
(Eq. (\ref{eq:cinque})) tagged
$b$-jets  becomes
\begin{equation}
P_{1-tag}^{m} = \sum_{q=1}^{n} p^{tag}_{q}   \left( \prod_{r=1,r\neq q}^{n} \left(1-p_{r}^{tag} \right) \right)
\label{eq:quattro}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P_{2-tag}^{m} = \sum_{q=1}^{n-1} p^{tag}_{q}  \left(\sum_{r>q}^{n} p^{tag}_{r}  \left( \prod_{s=1,s\neq q, s\neq r}^{n} \left(1-p_{s}^{tag} \right) \right) \right),  
\label{eq:cinque}
\end{equation}
where $p_{q}^{tag}$ is either the probability to tag the $q$th jet, multiplied by the SF, for jets where the 
heavy-flavor quark is found inside the jet cone; or the mistag probability for jets matched to a light-flavor hadron, calculated using the mistag
matrix.

Finally, we use the $P_{l-tag}^m$ as an event  weight to calculate the event-tagging efficiency $\epsilon^i_{tag}$
for each subsample with $l$ tags and $n$ jets by summing the $P_{l-tag}^{m}$ weights over all of the pretagged events.

The MC sample employed for the $t\bar{t}$ signal modeling is generated assuming
 $\left|V_{tb}\right| = 1$ so it cannot be used 
directly to calculate  $\epsilon^{i}_{tag}$ as a function of $R$ through the 
algorithm described above. 
Instead, in the MC sample we assign 
%for every jet matched to a $b$ quark coming from a $t$ quark at parton level, 
a random number $P_{b}$ in the interval [0, 1] to every jet that is matched at the parton level to a $b$ quark 
from $t$-quark decay.
If $P_{b} <R$ we consider this jet as genuinely originated by a $b$ quark and use the tag probability multiplied by the SF as in
Eq. (\ref{eq:quattro}) and  (\ref{eq:cinque}); otherwise this jet is regarded as a light-flavor 
jet.
This simulates a configuration in which a $b$ quark produced in the top 
decay is a real $b$ only $R$ fraction of the time while  $(1-R)$ fraction of the time it is treated as a 
light-flavor quark and it is weighted by the mistag probability. This probabilistic approach allows the 
calculation of background and signal sample composition for any value of $R$.
This method
 reproduces exactly the standard calculation in the case of $R=1$, 
simulates $t\rightarrow Wq$ for $R=0$, and allows a calculation of 
$\epsilon^i_{tag}(R)$ 
in each tag subsample and in each jet bin.  
Figure~\ref{fig:multipli} shows the comparison of observed and expected events assuming $R$ equal to 1, 
0.5, and 0.1 in the various jet multiplicities and number of $b$-tagged jets in the final state.

In order to compare the prediction to the observed data in the 18 subsamples we use a 
likelihood function. We fit the observed event yields in each class of events to determine 
simultaneously $R$ and $\sigma_{t\bar t}$.
The likelihood function is:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}=\prod_{i,j}\mathscr{P}\left(\mu^{i,j}_{exp}(R,\sigma_{t\bar t},x_{a})|N^{i,j}_{obs}\right)\prod_{a}G\left(x_{a}|0,1\right),
\end{equation}  
where $\mathscr{P}\left(\mu^{i,j}_{exp}(R,\sigma_{t\bar t},x_{a})|N^{i,j}_{obs}\right)$ is the Poisson probability to observe 
$N^{i,j}_{obs}$ events assuming the expected mean $\mu_{exp}^{i,j}$  (given by Eq. (\ref{eq:equationttexpected})), 
the index  $i$  indicates the jet-tag category, and the index  $j$ runs over the different lepton categories.
The estimates of the nuisance parameters $x_{a}$ are constrained to their central values and normalized to their 
uncertainties using Gaussian distributions  $G\left(x_{a}|0,1\right)$ centered at zero with unit variance.
This procedure takes into account correlations among channels by using same parameters for  
common sources of systematic uncertainties and allowing variations of each parameter  with respect to its central value. 

%In order to fit the parameters to the observed data 
We perform the minimization of 
the negative logarithm of the likelihood $-2\log\left(\mathcal{L}\right)$, 
using the {\sc minuit} package~\cite{minuit}. We analitically extend $\epsilon^i_{tag}(R)$ beyond $R=1$ during the fitting procedure, 
constraining each individual $\epsilon^i_{tag}(R)$ to be greater than zero and their sum  to be $\leq 1$.
%The starting point for the fit is the expectation for signal and background obtained 
%using $\sigma_{t\bar t}$ from a 
%CDF  measurement based on kinematic properties, $\sigma_{t\bar t} = 7.82 \pm 0.55$ pb~\cite{topkincross}. 
We simultaneously fit  $R$ and $\sigma_{t\bar t}$, which are the free parameters of the likelihood. 
We update the calculation of background yields using the value of $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$ determined by the fit
and iterate the previous steps until the procedure converges.
No dependence on the starting point was observed in the results of the iterative procedure.
%The fit converges to the same results also when starting the iterative procedure from the theoretical top-quark-production 
%cross section $\sigma_{ t\bar{t}}=7.04\pm 0.49$ pb. 


The uncertainty determined by the fit comprises the statistical contribution;  the systematic contribution on event-tagging efficiency, 
due to the systematic uncertainty on SF and the mistag matrix;  the event selection efficiency, 
due to the lepton-identification scale-factor and the trigger efficiency; 
 the background normalizations, 
including the heavy-flavor fractions; corrections for differences between MC and data heavy-flavor 
yields; and the luminosity~\cite{QCDback}.
We include separately the contributions due to the uncertainty on the jet-energy scale, 
effect of initial- and final-state radiation in the simulation (ISR/FSR), 
event-generator dependences, and top-quark mass.
The impact of the jet-energy scale uncertainty 
is estimated by varying the energy of all jets in the MC samples by  $\pm 1$ standard deviation 
with respect to the central value 
for both signal and backgrounds and by repeating the iterative fits.
The uncertainty arising from the choice of the MC generator is evaluated by repeating  the analysis
using a $t\bar t $ sample generated by {\sc herwig}~\cite{herwig}. 
The ISR/FSR uncertainty is evaluated by using $t\bar t $ MC samples generated with enhanced or suppressed 
radiation relative to the default configuration.
The theoretical value of the top-quark-production cross section depends on top-quark mass~\cite{masscrosscalc1}.
The recursive fit of $\sigma_{t\bar t}$ is expected to reduce 
%Since in this analysis we perform a recursive fit on $\sigma_{t\bar t}$ we expect to reduce 
the impact of this systematic uncertainty.
In order to check this assumption, we repeat the measurement 
using two different MC samples 
for the $t \bar t$ signal, simulated with $m_{t}=170$ GeV/$c^{2}$ and $m_{t}=175$ GeV/$c^{2}$, respectively. 
Central values and uncertainties on those systematic effects
 are included in the likelihood as nuisance parameters.

As a consistency check, the effect of each  source of systematic uncertainty is estimated via simulated 
experiments. For each source  we generate a set of simulated experiments with the same 
prescription but with the nuisance parameter $x_{a}$, relative to the 
systematic effect under study, shifted by one standard deviation from its nominal value.
 We determine the effect of changing each source of systematic uncertainty as 
 the change in the mean of the distributions of  $R$ 
and $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$. 
Table \ref{table:systematics} lists the various systematic uncertainties assumed as fully uncorrelated.

The final results 
%obtained with data from 8.7 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, 
are  summarized in Table \ref{table:resultssum}. 
 Figure \ref{fig:contorni}  shows the two-dimensional likelihood contour in the 
($R$, $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$) plane, for the  fit including statistical and systematic 
uncertainties. 
The best-fit value is indicated with a ``X'' and can be 
compared to the theoretical SM prediction at the next-to-leading (NLO) order expansion in the strong-interaction 
coupling constant~\cite{topxsec}. 
The results are in agreement with the theoretical prediction to within one standard deviation.

To determine the credibility level limit on $R$ 
we follow a Bayesian statistical approach. Since $R$ is bounded to be in 
the interval [0,1], the prior probability density 
is chosen to be zero outside these $R$ boundaries, 
while we consider all physical values equally probable. To obtain the posterior distribution for $R$, 
we integrate over all nuisance parameters using non-negative normal distributions as priors. 
We also integrate over $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$
with the only constraint to be positive defined. 
The Bayesian lower limits at 
$68$\% and $95$\% credibility levels  are shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:fitmargin} and yield $R>0.785$ at 95\% c.l. 
From Eq. (\ref{eq:Rratio}) we extract a measurement of $V_{tb}$. Assuming 
three generations of quarks and given the unitarity of the CKM matrix, we have 
$\left|V_{td}\right|^{2}+\left|V_{ts}\right|^{2}+\left|V_{tb}\right|^{2}=1$,
leading to $R=\left|V_{tb}\right|^{2}$. 
From the fit results we obtain $\left|V_{tb}\right|=0.97\pm0.05$ and 
$\left|V_{tb}\right|>0.89$ at 95\% credibility levels.

$\rho = - 0.434$. The magnitude of the CKM matrix element $\left|V_{tb}\right|$  is 
derived from $R=\left|V_{tb}\right|^{2}$. Lower limits at different

In summary, we present the simultaneous measurement of 
$R = 0.94 \pm 0.09$ and  $\sigma_{t\bar{t}} = 7.5 \pm 1.0$ pb with a 
correlation $\rho = -0.434$, 
and the determination of  $\left|V_{tb}\right| = 0.97 \pm 0.05$.  
The results for $R$ and $\left|V_{tb}\right|$ are the most precise determination obtained by CDF and 
%for  $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$, $R$ and $\left|V_{tb}\right|$ 
are in agreement with the standard model~\cite{PDG}, 
with the previous CDF measurements~\cite{R2005}, with the latest
measurement of $R$ performed by D0~\cite{d0meas}, 
%and CMS~\cite{CMS}, 
and with the direct  
measurement of single-top-quark production cross section 
 performed by LHC~\cite{singleLHC}  and Tevatron~\cite{singleTeV,singletop} experiments.

\bibitem{coord} We use a cylindrical coordinate system 
where the $z$ axis is along the proton beam direction, $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle, and 
$\theta$ is the polar angle. Pseudorapidity is $\eta = -\ln\tan(\theta/2)$, 
while transverse momentum is $p_{T}=\left|p\right|\sin\theta$, and transverse energy is $E_{T}=E\sin\theta$. 
Missing transverse energy, $\slashed{E}_{T}$, is defined as the magnitude of $-\sum_{i}E_{T}^{i}\hat{n}_{i}$, 
where $\hat{n}_{i}$ is the unit vector in the azimuthal plane 
that points from the beam line to the $i$th calorimeter tower.
The $W$ boson transverse mass is defined as
$M_{T}^{W} = \frac{1}{c^{2}}\sqrt{2 E_{T}^{l}\slashed E_{T}\left(1-\cos\phi_{l\nu}\right)}$,
where $E_{T}^{l}$ is the transverse energy of the lepton and $\phi_{l\nu}$ is the angle between the lepton and the $\slashed E_{T}$.
